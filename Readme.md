# Face Recognition Model

A Python-based face recognition model using machine learning.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required dependencies for python and import modules mentioned in the python files

## Usage

1. Run scanface.py file to take snapshots of few people.The same will be saved into directories with people name.
2. If you already have images and sequential rename has to be done ,use the file filerename.py
3. Once datasets are collected ,create a label file for model reference by running createlabel.py
4. Then run the file kerasfacereco.py for creating a prediction model.
5. Update execkerasmodel.py with your model name and run to try face recognition.
6. Prediciton depends on dataset quality and images preprocessing.Further preprocessing can be introduced for better prediction.

## Features

- Real-time face detection
